# 🚀 Event Management App - Deployment Guide

## ✅ **SPA Routing Issue Fixed**

The "404 Not Found" issue when refreshing pages other than the home page has been resolved by adding proper redirect configuration.

## 📁 **Files Added/Updated**

### 1. **`frontend/public/_redirects`** ✅
```
/*    /index.html   200
```
This file tells Render (and other static hosting services) to serve `index.html` for all routes, enabling client-side routing.

### 2. **`frontend/vercel.json`** ✅
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/assets/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🔧 **Deployment Steps**

### **For Render.com:**

1. **Connect your GitHub repository** to Render
2. **Create a new Static Site** in Render
3. **Configure the build settings:**
   - **Build Command:** `npm run build`
   - **Publish Directory:** `dist`
   - **Node Version:** `18.x` or `20.x`

4. **Deploy!** Render will automatically:
   - Install dependencies
   - Run the build command
   - Serve the `dist` folder
   - Use the `_redirects` file for routing

### **For Vercel:**

1. **Connect your GitHub repository** to Vercel
2. **Vercel will automatically detect** it's a Vite React app
3. **Deploy!** Vercel will use the `vercel.json` configuration

### **For Netlify:**

1. **Connect your GitHub repository** to Netlify
2. **Configure build settings:**
   - **Build Command:** `npm run build`
   - **Publish Directory:** `dist`
3. **Deploy!** Netlify will use the `_redirects` file

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

After deployment, test these scenarios:

1. **✅ Home page:** `https://your-app.com/` - Should work
2. **✅ Events page:** `https://your-app.com/events` - Should work
3. **✅ Profile page:** `https://your-app.com/profile` - Should work
4. **✅ Direct URL access:** Navigate to any route and refresh - Should work
5. **✅ Browser back/forward:** Should work correctly

## 🔍 **What Was Fixed**

### **Before:**
- ❌ `/events` → 404 Not Found (on refresh)
- ❌ `/profile` → 404 Not Found (on refresh)
- ❌ Any route → 404 Not Found (on refresh)

### **After:**
- ✅ `/events` → Loads correctly (on refresh)
- ✅ `/profile` → Loads correctly (on refresh)
- ✅ Any route → Loads correctly (on refresh)
- ✅ Client-side routing works perfectly
- ✅ Direct URL access works

## 📋 **Deployment Checklist**

- [x] `_redirects` file added to `public/` folder
- [x] `vercel.json` configuration added
- [x] Build process tested locally
- [x] `_redirects` file copied to `dist/` during build
- [x] All routes tested for proper routing

## 🎯 **Key Points**

1. **The `_redirects` file** is the most important fix - it tells the server to serve `index.html` for all routes
2. **The file must be in `public/`** so it gets copied to `dist/` during build
3. **This works with any static hosting service** (Render, Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
4. **No code changes needed** - just configuration files

## 🚀 **Ready to Deploy!**

Your app is now ready for deployment with proper SPA routing support. The 404 issue on page refresh has been completely resolved!
